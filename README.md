# Forth Parser

Based on Bradford J. Rodriguez's
[BNF parser](http://www.bradrodriguez.com/papers/bnfparse.htm).

Inspiration on updating from
[this](https://github.com/letoh/fina-forth/blob/master/bnf.fs).

## Goals

* Support yacc like actions.
* Allow inline strings + chars.
* Something like kleene star/plus. (TODO)
* Nicer syntax. (TODO)
* Structure as library.
